### How to initialize/run your application
    - Run python ten_thousand/game.py

### How to use your library 

    - pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    Currently have :
        - pygame==2.0.1
        - pytest==6.2.2

    However pytest is the only library in use if you wish to install only that.

## Tests

### How do you run tests?

**Using my eyeballs, I compared the simulation text to be as close as possible to the tests in [version_2]([tests\version_2](https://github.com/HighMid/ten-thousand/blob/main/tests/version_2/test_sim_basic.py))**

**Tested**

    - test_sim_basic.py, has functions testing simulated user interaction.

### Any tests of note?

- The `test_quitter()`, how could someone just boot up a game and not play it.

### Describe any tests that you did not complete, skipped, etc
