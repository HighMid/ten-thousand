## Tests

### How do you run tests?

**Using pytest, provided functions in game_logic.py to test the calculate_score.py and test_roll_dice.py .**

**Tested**

    - test_calculate_score.py, has functions testing calculate_score method in game_logic
    - test_roll_dice.py, has functions testing roll_dice method in game_logic    

### Any tests of note?

- The `three`, `four`, `five`, and `six_of_a_kind`, the confusion in passing `three_of_a_kind`.  `three` and `four` logic resulted in messed up logic for the other two.

### Describe any tests that you did not complete, skipped, etc
